            <p>
              Russell Comrie is a man of many and unusual interests. He holds
              multiple academic degrees in areas as diverse and arcane as
              medieval literature and modern physics. He has been a professional
              dance teacher, a lecturer, and a brand strategist. He is also a
              sought-after voiceover artist and has performed in theatrical
              productions in both South Africa and the UK.

              Throughout his magic career he has been drawn to and inspired by
              the work of the worldâ€™s greatest magicians: Lavand, Vernon,
              Tamariz, Williamson, and others. He has dedicated himself to
              perfecting the artistic side of magic, creating experiences that
              resonate long after the show is over.
            </p>
            <p>
              His goal is to draw people into the strange and marvellous world
              he prefers to inhabit: a world in which magic and reality blur and
              beauty is revealed behind the mundane.
            </p>
            <p>
              He also enjoys single malt scotch, piano music, and tweed jackets.
